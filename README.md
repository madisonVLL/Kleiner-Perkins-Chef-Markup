Hello! My name is Madison Vanderbilt. For my Kliener Perkin's Design Fellow Application, I decided to redesign elements of the Chef Robotics Website. Overall, I decided to showcase my current skills utilizing HTML, CSS, in addition to libraries such as JQuery and FontAwesome. I decided to add a little bit more warmth through changing the background colors. However, I also found it very importangt to reorganize and add more information to the home page. I want to further push Chef Robotics mission to possible clients. Additionally, I added a couple more elements as well(commented in html file). Thank you so much for your consideration!
